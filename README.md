# Cyberworkspace robotframework project by Testcoders

[Testcoders](https://www.testcoders.nl)

This repository is set up to assist in the workshop given by Testcoders for Cyberworkspace where we introduce Test Automation. In this workshop we make use of a Python test framework RobotFramwork

## Pre Requisites

To get this example work as expected The following need to be installed:
- Python - version 3.8 or higher
- Poetry - version 1.3 or higher

### IDE's:

Although an IDE is not obligated, a tool Like an IDE offers a lot of running and debugging capabilities for testing which will speed up the test development process.
Visual Studio Code is a preffered IDE to use. Although other IDE's like Pycharm, IntelliJ have simular capabilities, from our latest experience we can strongly advice the use of Visual Studio Code for the use of Robot Framework.

### IDE installation

When making use of Visual Studio Code, we reccommend to make use of extensions:
Python (Microsoft)

Open Visual studio Code, go to View > Exensions and install the requested extensions.

## Run Baby

When executing all these commands were succesfull, restart Visual Studio Code.
You might be prompted once to select the correct Python interpreter. Please select the one with: '.venv':poetry 

Verify a folder `.venv` is created in the root folder.

When opening the file `test.robot` in the editor play butttons should be visible and you can start executing the test from the IDE.
